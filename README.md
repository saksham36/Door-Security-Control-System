# Door-Security-Control-System

A door security system was designed using Proteus with a 8086 microprocessor. The system had 3 modes of operation - Master mode to set the alarm, Alarm mode to switch off the alarm and User mode for normal operation. Practical necessities were considered like buffers and Darlington transistors to drive the Stepper Motor. Completed for partial fulfilment of the course *Microprocessors and Interfacing* in BITS Pilani.
